look over line:

method SP request-target SP HTTP-version CRLF

when you find the first space you've passed the method, so then look for a /

when you find the / you're at the start of absolute-path which is one of the things you need to store, 

so begin saving with that character, into abs_path, until you hit either a ?, in which case you've found a query (make sure the query does not contain "), and should start storing into the query

if you don't find a questionmark but instead find another space first, you know you're onto the HTTP version and you're done.

if you find any errors in the request line you have to respond with err code 400

before any of that happens you have to check method to see if it's GET, any other method is err code 405

if you don't find / at the start of request target -> err 501

err code 400 if request-target has a "

and if HTTP-version is not HTTP/1.1 -> err code 505
